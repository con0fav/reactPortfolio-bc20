# Connor Favero React Portfolio

## Navigation

This is a basic portfolio built in React including links to projects I enjoy from my time at the coding bootcamp. Navigate to the [Github Pages](https://con0fav.github.io/reactPortfolio-bc20/) to view

## Future development

Improve layout, make each section a modular React element, add onto the barebones layout. Use this project for React practice.
